  <h1>Hi, here's some info.</h1>
  <p>A month ago, Gina (the owner of the EtikaRedditNetwork Discord) was banned from Discord.</p> 
  <p>I won't get into details but this resulted in the loss of a server owner, and with Discord's TOS rules saying that a server without an owner (especially banned), can result in a server deletion in 30 days. 
  Action was done.</p>
  <p>Because of this, Gina created a brand new Discord under the same name that she now has control over.</p>
  <p> This website has every single message, from it's start to November 7th, 2018. </p>
